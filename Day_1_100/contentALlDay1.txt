//definition of Variable
// --> variable are just container to store the data in any programming language

// to Declare Variable we can use (let,var,const)

// (var) is old style to define variable in js but has some issues in scope
let name = "Basant"

//(let) is newly introduced variable in recent es6 update, it is basically block scope.
let myName = "Basant"

//(const) is also newly introduced , it is also block scope but we cannot reassign it.
const mineName = "Basant"
console.log(mineName);



// Arithmetic Operators
//arithmetic operators are those operator which are involve in mathematical task
// = - * % / are the arithmetic operator

let a = 12,
  b = 13;
// console.log("c:", a+b)

// Assignment Operators
//in js assignment operator are those operators which help to assign a data or value to operator
// = is the assignment operator
let name = "basant";

// Comparison Operators
// comparison operator are those operator which help to compare two or more value in programming languages.

// < > <= >= ! are some comparison operator
// it throws either true or false in output
//  console.log(name!=b)
//  console.log(name>b)

// Logical Operators
//logical operator are those operators which are basically used in logical operation
// && -> logical and
// || -> logical or
// ! ->  logical not
// a && b
// a || b;
// a ^ b;

// Ternary Operators

let nameA = "Ayush"
let NameB = "Ayusha"
let compare2 = (nameA.length > NameB.length) ?  console.log(`${nameA.length}${nameA}`) : console.log(`${NameB.length} ${NameB}`);


//if else

//basically control structure is construct that alter the flow of program execution.
// basically if else switch for loop while and do while loop are the control structure


//conditional are the block of the code which help to execute our program in different condition

// if(true) //do something else do something next

// if(false) console.log("hello world i am true.") 
// else console.log("hello world i am false.")

// only else will execute when if condition is false
let a = 10, b =10
if(a>b){console.log(a)} else if (a==b){console.log("they are equal")} else{console.log(b)}

//loops -> iteration 
//loop is the sequence of repetitive which will not finish until condition doesn't match.

// there are several loops in programming language but we mostly use for,while, do while and for each loop in js 

// syntax for for loop

//for(initialization condition increment/decrement){code}


// basic program example of for loop 
let  num =10;
for (let i = 1; i <=num; i++) {
    const element = i;
    // console.log(element);
    
}
//working mechanism of for loop 
// while starting the loop at first we initialize value and give condition then loop enter in the block code and check either it is iterating or not 

//program to print the multiplication of program to 5 
let multiplyValue = 5
for (let i = 1; i<=multiplyValue; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <=10; j++) {
    //    console.log(`${i} *${j} = ${i*j}`);
    } 
}


//function is a block of code which we can call anywhere to reduce the code 

function myName(){
    let name = "Basant"
    return name
  }
  
  // console.log(myName())
  let fullName = "my name is " +myName() + " joshi"
  // console.log(fullName)
  
  
  //function have two important element they are arguments and parameters
  //parameters are those values which are initialized while declaring function under the parenthesis of function
  
  function hisName(par){
      return par
  }
  //above par is paramter of the function 
  
  
  //argument are those value which we pass to the function while calling the function
  // console.log(hisName("hello Basant")) // -> this is the example of function
  
  //in the js there are many types of function in js but we must use arrow function and normal function 
  
  //example of normal function 
  // function myFun (){}
  
  
  //example of arrow function
  // let myFun = ()=>{}
  
  // exercise for arrow function 
  
  
  // Arrow Function Question:
  
  // Write an arrow function called doubleNumbers that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each number is doubled.
  let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  
  let doubleArrayElement = arr.map((value)=>{
      return value*2
  })
  
  // console.log(doubleArrayElement)
  
  // Create a traditional function called calculateFactorial that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number.
  
  let factorial = 1
  function factorialOfNum(value){
      for(let i=1; i<=value; i++){
          factorial = factorial *i
      }
      return factorial
      
  
  }
  // console.log(factorialOfNum(5))
  
  // Create a function called getTicketCategory that takes two parameters: age (a number) and isStudent (a boolean indicating whether the person is a student or not). that distribute category
  
  
  function checkCategories(per){
      if(per>=10){
          console.log("Child")
      }
      else if(person >=15){
          console.log("Student")
      }
      else if(per >=20){
          console.log("Teen")
      }
      else{
          console.log("Adult")
      }
      return per
  }
  
  // console.log(checkCategories(10))
