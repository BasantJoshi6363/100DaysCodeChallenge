//definition of Variable
// --> variable are just container to store the data in any programming language

// to Declare Variable we can use (let,var,const)

// (var) is old style to define variable in js but has some issues in scope
let name = "Basant"

//(let) is newly introduced variable in recent es6 update, it is basically block scope.
let myName = "Basant"

//(const) is also newly introduced , it is also block scope but we cannot reassign it.
const mineName = "Basant"
console.log(mineName);
